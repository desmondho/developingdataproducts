Project: Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

set.seed(1976-05-20)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(50, min = 32.0, max = 32.8),
                 lng = runif(50, min = -96.8, max = -96.0))


df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 32.0, max = 32.8),
                 lng = runif(500, min = -96.8, max = -96.0))
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())


```
